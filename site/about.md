# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Martin.

I'm a software developer from ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ª Estonia, currently located in ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ London, England.

I've been a [hacker](http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html) professionally since 2009, when I started as
an intern in Skype. I honed my chops there, and subsequently in Microsoft, over the next 5 years.
I then seized the opportunity to build and manage the software development team at a
[startup creating a mobile app testing business](https://angel.co/company/testlio).
These days I work for [Snap](https://www.snap.com).

I'm passionate about the open web and belive it's the basis for improving our experience on it.
I think some of the best content today is still delivered via web feeds, in the form of blog posts
and podcasts.

I started this blog inspired by the [many](https://blog.jessfraz.com)
[people](https://alexwlchan.net) out there, who [write](https://christine.website) on
[their own](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/) beautiful [websites](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/).
I hope to better my skills in writing, make it into a habit and hopefully convey something
useful along the way.
