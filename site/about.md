# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Martin.

I'm a software developer from ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ª Estonia, currently located in ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ London, England.

I've been a hacker professionally since 2009, when I started as an intern in Skype.
I honed my chops there, and subsequently in Microsoft, over the next 5 years.
I then seized the opportunity to build and manage the software development team at a
[startup creating a mobile app testing business](https://angel.co/company/testlio).

These days I'm self-employed, I work with clients to improve on existing, or design and build new
software on public cloud environments. I focus mostly on backend code and infrastructure work, but
have also taken on full stack development to get a new application off the ground. If that sounds like
something you could use help with, feel free to [get in touch](mailto:{{ social.email }}).

I'm passionate about the open web and belive it's the basis for improving our experience on it.
I think some of the best content today is still delivered via web feeds, in the form of blog posts
and podcasts.

I started this blog inspired by the many people out there, who write on their own beautiful
websites. I hope to better my skills in writing, make it into a habit and hopefully convey something
useful along the way.

I'm open to taking on new challenges in a permanent role. If you think we have aligning interests
you can check out my [resume](/resume) and [reach out](maltio:{{ social.email }}).
